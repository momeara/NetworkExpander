  <comment>Overview
Given a selection of query nodes, the NetworkExpander App expands the network by adding additional nodes and edges connecting with the query nodes obtained from a web server. 

Workflow
Have existing network
Select a set of nodes
Right-click on node (or use Apps menu)
Send list of keys (node names?) to server
Get back JSON file with edges (and potentially node information)
Adjust expansion network to filter
query/query, query/non-query, and/or non-query/non-query edges
filter expansion by threshold

Network Server Configuration
Expansion network data retrieved by a REST/JSON web API. Using the syntax for the linkout query, a cytoscape.js elements JSON file is returned and merged with the active network using the node name key.
